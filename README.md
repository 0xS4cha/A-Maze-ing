# Description
This project is a python project focused on understanding and implementing maze generation and maze solving algorithms by using a graphic library. 
This project contains two algorithms: `Recursive Backtracking` and `Eller` algorithms.

# Instructions

# Configuration File
```bash
# this is a comment

# width of the maze
WIDTH=53
# height of the maze
HEIGHT=53

# position of the entry point of the maze (x, y)
ENTRY=1,1
# position of the exit point of the maze (x, y)
EXIT=49,49

# path of the output file
OUTPUT_FILE=output.txt

# the generated maze contains only one solution
PERFECT=0

# view generation and resolving in realtime
ANIMATION=1

# use graphic library or ASCII style rendering
GRAPHIC=1
```

# Resources
This is the list of the resources used to make this project. 
- [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze-solving_algorithm) used for the maze solving algorithms
- [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm) used to understand the maze generation techniques
- [emrezorlu.com](https://emrezorlu.com/2012/03/20/maze-creation-solving/) used to understand the differences between the different algorithms
- [professor-l.github.io](https://professor-l.github.io/mazes/) used to visualise concepts behind used algorithms
- [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com) was used to explain us basics of each algorithm. It also helped with colors and the minilib-x library

## TODO
- [ ] You must implement the maze generation as a unique class
- [ ] Use frameworks like pytest or unittest for unit tests, covering edge cases.
- [ ] Your functions should handle exceptions gracefully to avoid crashes
- [ ] Use PEP 257 for docstrings
- [ ] Use type definition and check using `mypy`
- [x] Makefile using rules `install` `run` `debug` `clean` `lint-strict` and `lint`
- [x] Add a `.gitignore`
- [ ] Create test programs to verify project functionality
- [ ] Use venv
- [ ] Fix `makefile`: add install `mlx`
- [ ] A default configuration file must be available in your Git repository
- [ ] The maze must be randomly generated, but reproducibility via a seed is required
- [ ] You must provide a short documentation describing how to:
	- [ ] Instantiate and use your generator, with at least a basic example.
	- [ ] Pass custom parameters (e.g., `size`, `seed`).
	- [ ] Access the generated structure, and access at least a solution.
- [ ] Fix `README.md`


This entire reusable module (code and documentation) must be available in a single file
suitable for a later installation by pip.
This package must be called mazegen-* and the file must be located at the root of your
git repository.
Both .tar.gz and .whl extensions are allowed, as generated by the standard build of a
Python package.
Example of a full filename: mazegen-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl .
You must provide in you Git repository all needed elements to build the package. This
will be asked during the evaluation: in a virtualenv or equivalent, install the needed tools
and build your package again from your sources.
The main README.md file (not part of the reusable module) must also contain this short
documentation.
